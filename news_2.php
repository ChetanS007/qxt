          <div class="para-text">
            QuantXpress is excited to announce the launch of its Tick-by-Tick (TBT) data streaming technology, designed specifically for brokers and trading members of Indian exchanges. This groundbreaking technology enables users to capture real-time order book data and trades even without being in a co-location setup.<br><br>
          </div>

          <div class="para-text">
            Tick-by-Tick data delivers comprehensive insights by providing detailed information for every tick received by the exchange from various market participants. It captures every single trade executed at the exchange, offering a precise view of market activity in each timeframe without missing any critical data points. Traditionally, due to the vast volume of data generated, TBT data has only been accessible within the co-location facilities of the National Stock Exchange (NSE). This type of data is essential for high-frequency traders, algorithmic trading systems, and researchers who require an in-depth understanding of market microstructure, liquidity patterns, and exact price movements.<br><br>
          </div>

          <div class="para-text">
            Brokers’ proprietary desks and their clients consistently seek the highest quality market data available outside of co-location setups for enhanced research and optimal trade execution. QuantXpress's innovative technology provides access to granular data as a streaming solution that can be easily integrated with brokers’ retail platforms.<br><br>
          </div>

          <div class="para-text">
            With the new TBT technology, brokers can now capture high-quality data directly into their trading systems. This technology is seamlessly integrated with BlitzTrader, QuantXpress's flagship algorithmic trading platform.<br><br>
